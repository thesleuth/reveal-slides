### What do successful apps do

A successful app attempts to solve a problem with some task that a computer can do easily. Some common tasks that computers are good at are

* Supplying Data
* Giving Feedback
* Setting Reminders
* Asking for inforation from others
* Performing Repetitive tasks

-

### What does your app solve

* Set reminders for physical tasks?
* Repeat digital tasks on a schedule?
* Storing notes about events and products?
* Alert others to events?
* Connect potential people of interest?

-

### Breaking Down an App

When talking about an app, it is often done in the form of user stories. You often have to consider a few things about these stories

* Types of users
* Data each type of user can see
* Data users are supposed to supply
* Are there admins?
* What counts as abuse of your app?

-

### What do successful apps do

The one question you should be asking at every point of making your app

What problem does my app solve?

# Common Types of Apps

-

### Breaking Down Ideas

While not all apps fall into these categories, most ideas wind up being some version of the following

* Uber for X
* Tinder for X
* Subscription Boxes
* Maps with Prefilled Data
* Joke Apps

-

### Breaking Down Ideas

These ideas are all usually acceptable, but may not be offering value you believe

-

### Breaking Down Ideas

Do other apps already do this?
- Google maps can already be used to find spots of interest
- You don't need an Uber for Dog Walkers because Dog Walking Services already exist
- Grocery Stores have a spice aisle. People don't need oregano shipped to their door on a monthly basis

-

### Breaking Down Ideas

Does your app require too much from your user

- Apps that ask users for lots of personal information
- Apps that need businesses to volunteer work/IP
- Apps that need a critical mass of users 
- Apps with high fees due to low scale

-

### Breaking Down Ideas

Does your app actually address the problem

- Asking for reviews doesn't actually solve figuring out where to go out to eat
- Reminding someone about appointments they have 30 minutes early doesn't help them show up on time 
- A soundboard of farts from across film history doesn't actually make people laugh

-
-

### Uber for X

Generally a term used for Apps that are structured around summoning strangers for services

Typically these apps are great for when the services are typically found already but can be streamlined. These apps generally need to be beneficial for people seeking a service and people performing the service

-

### Maps with Prefilled Data

Maps are apps that show location data about an area, typically the location of the user. Map apps can be useful for locating notable locations, though these tend to fall in a lot of pit traps.

### Maps with Prefilled Data - Coffee Find NearBy

-

### Maps with Prefilled Data - Coffee Find NearBy

* What personal information are you asking of your user?
* What data here can't be found on Google Maps?
* What search term in Google could you use to find the same information?

No second example needed. If you can get the same results by putting a search term into Google Maps and looking at the screen, the idea will not survive.

-

### Maps with Prefilled Data

Many new map apps come out and are very successful for various reasons. They might:

* offer data ignored by Google Maps
* rank locations with data that is not location
* have a critical mass of users that allows for some social interactions

-

### Maps with Prefilled Data

The last reason they might work is they are actually just interfaces of Google Maps rebranded as something else. These typically work by just giving users less options to streamline searching for a spot.

### Joke Apps

Jokes Apps are designed to be a gag of some sort. They might still have some use outside of their novelty, but the primary reason for their existence is to be humorous or for no reason

## !!SURPRISE!! - Social Media

One more app that isn't talked about in these slides is Social Media. 

A social media app is going to take a lot of forms but generally it is an app where the main goal is to have people communicate or interact with each other. The primary product you are offering in these cases is the peers of the person using the app.

-

### Social Media

Social media asks a lot of your users and offers data that is accessible to them via human interaction as the reward for participating. Most social medias that try to be social media for specific sub groups wind up being less effective than a general forum or Facebook group.
