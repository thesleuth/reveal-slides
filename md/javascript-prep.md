## Thinking Like A Programmer

Computers are great at *processing*. They are bad at *understanding*.

When you write a program, you must break down every step into simple pieces.

-

## Drawing Square on a white board

1. Find a whiteboard and a dry erase marker.
2. Uncap the dry erase maker.
3. Hold the marker in your hand.
4. Place the marker against the whiteboard.
5. Move your hand 1 foot to the right.
6. Stop.
7. Move your hand 1 foot down...

-

## Statements

Each instruction in JavaScript is a statement.

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
console.log('Nice to meet you');
console.log('I love donuts');
```

-

## Comments

```javascript
/*
You can make long comments
with multiple lines here
*/

console.log('Hello World!'); // Or make short comments here
```

-

## Variables

Just like 'x' in algebra, a variable is a named container for a value that can change.

-

## Declaring Variables

Two ways to declare a variable: the bad way and the better way

```javascript
// This line of code sets the variable latitude to the number 40.7
let latitude = 40.7;

// This line of code sets the variable inNorthernHemisphere to true
let inNorthernHemisphere = true;

// variable values can be reassigned
latitude = 29.8;
inNorthernHempisphere = false;
```

-

## Constants

A constant is a named container for a value that can't be reassigned.

```javascript
// This line of code sets the variable location to the string New York City
const location = 'New York City';

// const values cannot be reassigned;
location = "Philadelphia"; // creates an error
```

-

## Declaring variables vs assigning value

You can declare variables and assign their value later.

```javascript
let location;

location = "Philadelphia";
```

-
-

## Data Types
``string`` string of characters
```javascript
let userName = 'Jane Lane';
```
``number`` integer or floating point
```javascript
let myAge = 30;
```
``boolean`` true or false
```javascript
let catsAreBest = true;
```
``undefined`` value that hasn't been defined
```javascript
let favoriteThings;
```
``null`` an explicitly empty value
```javascript
let goodPickupLines = null;
```
-

## Data Types

``object`` a set of key value pairs, i.e. properties and property values
```javascript
let car = {
    make: "ford",
    model: "taurus"
}
```

``array`` a collection of data
```javascript
let array = ["donuts", "pizza", "potato chips"];
```

-

## JavaScript is not type safe

Variable types can be reassigned;

```javascript
let numberOfDonuts = 4; // numberOfDonuts is a number
numberOfDonuts = "four"; // numberOfDonuts is now a string
```

Reassigning types can cause unexpected errors. Be careful!

-
-

## Numbers

Numbers in JavaScript can either be integers or floats (decimal numbers).
JavaScript automatically converts integers to floats when necessary.

```javascript
let numberOfDonuts = 12;
let donutRating = 10.2;
```

Once we have numbers, we can use them in operations

```javascript
let totalDonutRating = numberOfDonuts * donutRating;
```

## Arithmetic Operators
<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Example</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Result</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>-a</code></td>
        <td> Negation</td>
        <td>Opposite of <code>a</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a + b</code></td>
        <td>Addition</td>
        <td>Sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a - b</code></td>
        <td>Subtraction</td>
        <td>Difference of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a * b</code></td>
        <td>Multiplication</td>
        <td>Product of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a / b</code></td>
        <td>Division</td>
        <td>Quotient of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a % b</code></td>
        <td>Modulus</td>
        <td>Remainder of <code>a</code> divided by <code>b</code>.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
 </table>

-
 
 ## The += operator
 
 We can easily add a number to itself using the ``+=`` operator
 ```javascript
 let sum = 0;
 sum = sum + 2;
 console.log(sum) // sum is equal to 2
 ```
 
 ```javascript
 let sum = 0;
 sum += 2;
 console.log(sum) // sum is equal to 2
 ``` 

-
-
 
 ## Strings
 
 Strings are a collection of characters. You can wrap a string in single or double quotes.
 
 ```javascript
 let favoriteDonut = 'chocolate';
 let otherFavoriteDonut = "strawberry sprinkled".
 ```
 
 Because JavaScript uses quotes to begin and end strings, if you want to use quotes in a string, you need to *escape* it.
 
 ```javascript
 let sentence = 'Jawn\'s donut shop is the best donut shop.'
 ```
-
 
 ## Adding Strings
 
 We can *concatenate* strings using the ``+`` operator.
 ```javascript
 let firstName = "Jawn";
 let lastName = "Doe";
 let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
 ```
 
 You can also use the ``+=`` operator
 
 ```javascript
 let fullName = "";
 fullName += "Jawn"
 fullName += " ";
 fullName += "Doe"
 ```

-
 
 ## Combining Strings and Numbers
 
 When concatenating strings and numbers, numbers are automatically converted to strings.
 
 ```javascript
 let numberOfDonuts = 2;
 let typeOfDonuts = "chocolate";
 let stock = "We have " + numberOfDonuts + " " + typeOfDonuts + " " + "donuts.";
 ```

-
-

## Objects 

Objects let us store a set of properties, also known as key value pairs

```javascript
let object = {
    property: propertyValue,
    property2: propertyValue2,
}
```

```javascript
let user = {
    username: "donutLover5000",
    birthday: {month: "april", day: 5}
}
```

-

## Accessing Object Properties

You can use dot notation to access object properties

```javascript
console.log(user.username) // outputs donutLover5000
```

Or you can use bracket notation and pass in a string representing the property
```javascript
console.log(user['username']) // outputs donutLover5000
```
-

## Changing Objects

You can use dot or bracket notation to change property values

```javascript
user.username = "pooBear";
user['username'] = "pooBear";
```

-
-

## Functions

**Good programmers are lazy programmers.**

Print out all the numbers between 1 and 10.
```javascript
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.log(3)
console.log(4)
console.log(5)
console.log(6)
console.log(7)
console.log(8)
console.log(9)
console.log(10)
```

-

## Do not repeat yourself

```javascript
// prints the numbers between 1 and 10
function print10() {
    for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
-

## Create generalized, reusable code

Print all the numbers between 1 and n
```javascript
// prints all the numbers between 1 and n
function printN(n) {
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
-

## Anatomy of a function

To declare (create) a function, you can give it a name, then 
include all the code for the function inside curly brackets 

```javascript

// function keyword - function name - parameters
function printN(n) {
    // code block
}
```

-

## Parameters

Parameters, also called arguments, are named containers for a value that will be passed in.

```javascript
// firstNum and secondNum act as aliases for concrete values passed in later
function add(firstNum, secondNum) {
    console.log(firstNum + secondNum);
}

add(2, 2) // prints 4;
```
We can use, or call, the function by its name, passing in required parameters in parenthesis.

-

## Parameter Values

Parameters are assigned values based on the order they are passed into the function.

```javascript
function subtract(firstNum, secondNum) {
    console.log(secondNum - firstNum);
    console.log(firstNum - secondNum);
}

subtract(4, 2) // Prints 2, then -2
```
-

## Parameters are not type specific

```javascript
function add(firstNum, secondNum) {
    console.log(firstNum + secondNum);
}

function subtract(firstNum, secondNum) {
    console.log(secondNum - firstNum);
    console.log(firstNum - secondNum);
}

add("pizza", "donuts");
subtract("pizza", "donuts");
```
-

## Parameters are not type specific

We expected to use numbers in our function, but instead we were passed strings.

Now what?

```javascript
add("pizza", "donuts"); // prints pizzadonuts
subtract("pizza", "donuts"); //prints NaN
```
-

## Parameters are not type specific

```javascript
add("pizza", "donuts"); // prints pizzadonuts
subtract("pizza", "donuts"); //prints NaN
```

JavaScript uses the ``+`` operator to concat strings, so it 
knows what to do when it sees two strings being added together.

Unfortunately, JavaScript doesn't know how to subtract two strings,
so it prints out NaN (Not a Number) when attempting to subtract strings.

Neither of these behaviors were our intention. Be careful with your types!

-

## Parameters of Varying Type

```javascript
function calc(firstNum, secondNum, operation) {
    if(operation === "add") {
        console.log(firstNum + secondNum);
    }
    
    if(operation === "subtract") {
        console.log(firstNum - secondNum);
    }
}

calc(2, 4, "add"); // prints 6

// be careful with order
calc("add", 2, 4): // not what we want
```

-

## Literal vs Variable Parameters

We can pass in literal values (values not attached to a variable reference) 
into a function, or values stored in a variable or constant;

```javascript
const operation = "add";
let firstNum = 2;

calc(firstNum, 4, operation);
```

-

## The Return Keyword

We can pass back the results of our function and use that as a value.

Instead of printing out our results of adding two numbers, let's ``return``
the value so we can use it

```javascript
function add(firstNum, secondNum) {
    return firstNum + secondNum;
}
```

-

## The Return Keyword

When we return a value, we can use it in operations, or store it to a variable (or constant).

```javascript
let sum = add(4, 2);
```

```javascript
let sum = add(4, 2) + 9;
```

```javascript
let sum = add(4, 2) + add(3, 6);
```
-

## The Return Keyword

No matter where return appears in the function, return always 
exits out of the function. Nothing beyond a return will be executed.

```javascript
function add(4, 2) {
    // exits out of the function
    return true;
    // nothing below this line is excuted
    
    console.log(4, 2) // statement is never reached.
}
```

Once the function has its ``return`` value, there's no longer a need
for it to continue further. 

-
-

# Control Flow

-

## The If Statement

Use ``if`` statements to decide which lines of code to execute, based on a condition.

```javascript
if(condition) {
    // statements to excute
}
```

```javascript
let age = 30;

if (age > 18) {
  console.log('You are an adult');
}
```

JavaScript evaluates conditions to a ``boolean``, ``true`` or ``false``.

## Comparison Operators

<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Example</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Result</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a == b</code></td>
        <td>Equal</td>
        <td><strong><code>TRUE</code></strong> if <code>a</code> is equal to <code>b</code> (can be different types).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a === b</code></td>
        <td>Identical</td>
        <td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a != b</code></td>
        <td>Not equal</td>
        <td><strong><code>TRUE</code></strong> if <code>a</code> is not equal to <code>b</code> (can be different types).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>a !== b</code></td>
        <td>Not identical</td>
        <td><strong><code>TRUE</code></strong> if <code>a</code> is not equal to <code>b</code>, or they are not the same type.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

-

## Truthy and Falsy

```javascript
function logTruthiness(val) {
    if(val) {
        console.log("Truthy!");
    } else {
        console.log("Falsy.");
    }
}
```
-

## Truthy and Falsy

```javascript
// Outputs: "Truthy!"
logTruthiness(true);

// Outputs: "Truthy!"
logTruthiness({});

// Outputs: "Truthy!"
logTruthiness([]);

// Outputs: "Truthy!"
logTruthiness("some string");

// Outputs: "Truthy!"
logTruthiness(3.14);
```

-

## Truthy and Falsy

```javascript
// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness(false);

// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness(null);

// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness(undefined);

// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness(NaN);

// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness(0);

// Outputs: "Falsy."
logTruthiness("");
```

-

## The if else statement

If you have multiple conditions, you can use ``else if``.

```javascript
let age = 30;

if (age >= 35) {
  console.log('You can vote AND run for President!'); // win not run
} else if (age >= 30) {
  console.log('You can vote AND run for the Senate!'); // will run
} else if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You can vote!'); // will not run
} else {
  console.log('You can\'t vote, but you can write your representatives.'); // will run
}
```

Only one condition will be met.

-

## Combining Individual If Statements

```javascript
let age = 30;

// individual if statement
if (age >= 35) {
  console.log('You can vote AND run for President!'); // will not run
}

if (age >= 30) {
  console.log('You can vote AND run for the Senate!'); // win run
} 

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You can vote!'); // will run
} else {
  console.log('You can\'t vote, but you can write your representatives.'); // will not run
}
```
-

## Combining Conditionals

You can use logical operators to combine conditions

```javascript
let age = 30;
let yearsAsCitizen = 30;

// If you are over 30 and you've been a citizen for over 9 years
if (age >=30 && yearsAsCitizen > 9) {
  console.log('You can run for the Senate!');
} else {
  console.log('You are not eligible to run for the Senate');
}
```

```javascript
let birthYear = 1992;

// If you were born before 1980 or born after 2000
if(birthYear < 1980 || birthYear > 2000) {
    console.log('You are not a millennial');
}
```

-
## The Switch Statement

The ``switch`` expression is evaluated once. The value of the expression is compared with the 
values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

```javascript
let numericalDay = 1;

switch (numericalDay) {
    case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        day = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        day = "Saturday";

```
-

## The Switch Statement

* If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.

* If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.

* If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.

* Switch cases use strict comparison (===).
  
* The values must be of the same type to match.

-

## The Break Keyword

* When JavaScript reaches a ``break`` keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

* This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

* When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a ``break``. There is no need for more testing.
A ``break`` can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

* It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.

-

## The Default Keyword

If today is neither Saturday (6) nor Sunday (0), write a default message.

```javascript
let numericalDay = 1;

switch (numericalDay) {
    case 6:
        text = "Today is Saturday";
        break; 
    case 0:
        text = "Today is Sunday";
        break; 
    default: 
        text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
```

-

## Common Cases

Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

```javascript
let numericalDay = 1;

switch (numericalDay) {
    case 4:
    case 5:
        text = "Soon it is Weekend";
        break; 
    case 0:
    case 6:
        text = "It is Weekend";
        break;
    default: 
        text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
```
-

## The Ternary Operator

Evaluates a condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the operator returns the value of expr1.
Else, it returns the value of expr2.
```javascript
condition ? expr1 : expr2 
```

```javascript
let examScore = 91;
let didIGetAnA = (examScore >= 90) ? "You got an A!" : "You didn't get an A";
```
Shorthand for:
```javascript
let examScore = 90;
let didIGetAnAn;
if(exam Score > 90) {
    didIGetAnA = "You got an A!";
} else {
    didIGetAnA = "You did not get an A.";
}
```
-
-

## Quick note about functions

Functions can be stored to variables or constants
```javascript
let printN = function() {
    // ...
}
```
-

When storing functions as variables or constants, we can use shorthand notation, called ``arrow functions``.

```javascript
let printN = () => {
    // ...
}
```
-

When we have one parameter, we parenthesis are optional. 

```javascript
let printN = n => {
    // ...
}
```
-

If you have 0 or more than 1 parameter, you must include the parenthesis. 
```javascript
// I
let add = (firstNum, secondNum) => {
    firstNum * secondNum;
}

let greet = () => {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

-
-

## Scope

Variables defined in the global scope are declared outside of a set of curly braces {}, referred to as a block, 
and are available throughout a program. 

```javascript
let fullName = "Jawn Doe";

function greet() {
    return "Hello " + fullName;
}

function farewell() {
    return "Bye " + fullName;
}
```
-

Variables defined in the global scope are open to mutation.

```javascript
let state = "Delaware";

let capitol = "Dover";

function printStateCapitol() {
    capitol = "Newark";
    console.log("The capitol of " + state " is " + capitol);
}

printStateCapitol();

console.log(capitol); // prints dover
```
This can create unintended consequences.

-

*"But I wouldn't do something silly like that."*

* You'll be working with a team of people, who won't understand your code as well as you do.
* You'll write tens of thousands of lines of code over your career, and forget a lot what your old code is doing.

-

We can prevent against values being changed using ``const``.

```javascript
const state = "Delaware";

const capitol = "Dover";

function printStateCapitol() {
    capitol = "Newark"; // Throws an error, which will stop your program
    console.log("The capitol of " + state " is " + capitol);
}
```
-

Instead of relying on global variables, we can write our functions to rely on parameters we give it.

```javascript
let state = "Delaware";

let capitol = "Dover";

function printStateCapitol(state, capitol) {
    capitol = "Newark";
    console.log("The capitol of " + state + " is " + capitol);
}

console.log(capitol); // prints Dover
```

-

Parameters are a special kind of variable that are assigned to the value passed in it, and scoped only to the function.

```javascript
let state = "Delaware";

let capitol = "Dover";

function printStateCapitol(state, capitol) {
    capitol = "Newark";
    // Prints "The capitol of Delaware is Newark"
    console.log("The capitol of " + state + " is " + capitol);
}

console.log(capitol); // prints Dover
```
-

When JavaScript encounters a variable, it looks to see if that variable is available in it's code block. 

If it's not, it moves up the line of scope until it finds it.

```javascript
let state = "Delaware";

let capitol = "Dover";

function printStateCapitol(state, capitol) {
    capitol = "Newark";
    // Prints "The capitol of Delaware is Newark"
    console.log("The capitol of " + state + " is " + capitol);
}

console.log(capitol); // prints Dover
```
-

Variables can also be *locally scoped*. A new scope is created for each block of code between a set of curly braces.

Local variables are available within their code block, and any nested code blocks.


```javascript
// global scope (scope 1)
let radius = 2;

function calcAreaOfCircle(radius) {
    // local scope (scope 2)
    has access to scope 1 and scope 2 */
    const pi = 3.14;
    
    function calcDiameter() {
       /* local scope (scope 3)
       has access to scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 */
       let diameter;
       
       /* has access to the radius variable, 
       even though it wasn't passed into the function
       as a parameter */
       diameter = radius * 2;
       return diameter;
    }
    
    // Uncaught ReferenceError: diameter is not defined
    return pi * diameter;
}

calcAreaOfCircle(radius);

// Uncaught ReferenceError: pi is not defined
console.log(pi);

```
-

Other types of code blocks, like ``loops`` and ``if statements`` also create local scope.

```javascript
/* Global scope (scope 1)
Has access to scope 1 */
let n = 100;

function countByTenToN() {
    /* Local scope (scope 2)
    Has access to scope 1 and scope 2 */
    let currentNum = 0;
    
    while (currentNum <= 100) {
        /* Local scope (scope 3)
        Has access to scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 */
        let iterator = 10;
        console.log(10
        currentNum += 10;
    }
    
    // Uncaught ReferenceError: iterator is not defined
    console.log(iterator);
    
}
```
-

The ``let`` and ``const`` keywords create brand new variables, and can share names with other variables
as long as they are located within a different level of scope.

```javascript
// Global scope (scope 1)
let radius = 2;
const pi = 3.14

function calcAreaOfCircle(radius) {
    // Local scope (scope 2)
    const pi = 3.141; // creates a new variable pi scoped within the curly braces.
    
    return pi * radius * radius;
}

// Global scope (scope 1)
const pi = 3.1415; // duplicate declaration of pi exists within this scope, creates an error

```

-

## The wilder days of JavaScript

The ``let`` and ``const`` keywords are new features of JavaScript available in the most recent specs.

Before ``let`` and ``const``, we'd declare variables with ``var``, which didn't follow the same scoping rules.

-

With ``var``, only functions create brand new levels of scope.

```javascript
// Global scope (scope 1)
var n = 100;

function countByTenToN() {
    // Local scope (scope 2)
    Has access to scope 1 and scope 2 */
    var currentNum = 0;
    
    while (i <= 100) {
        Has access to scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 */
        var iterator = 10;
        console.log(10
        currentNum += 10;
    }
    
    // available from outside it's block
    console.log(iterator);
}
```

-
-

## Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of values.

```javascript
var arrayName = [value0, value1];
```

```javascript
You can put different types of data into an array.

let rainbowColors = ['Red', 'Orange', 'Yellow', 'Green',
  'Blue', 'Indigo', 'Violet'];

let luckyNumbers = [52, 97, 91, 28, 43, 104];

let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];
```

You can find the length of an array using the ``length`` property.

```javascript
console.log(myFavoriteThings.length); // prints 4;
```

-

## Accessing Array Elements

You can access array elements with bracket notation, passing in the ``index`` of the element.

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

console.log(myFavoriteThings[0]); // prints Donuts
console.log(myFavoriteThings[3]); // prints Pizza
```

Array start at index **0** and move upward.

-

## Changing Arrays

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];
```

To remove the last element of an array, use ``pop``.

```javascript
myFavoriteThings.pop();
// myFavoriteThings now contains ['Donuts', 42, true]
```

To remove the first element of an array, use ``shift``

```javascript
myFavoriteThings.pop();
// myFavoriteThings now contains [42, true]
```

To add to an array, use ``push``. The new element will be added to the end of the array.

```javascript
myFavoriteThings.push('coffee');

// myFavoriteThings now contains [42, true, 'coffee'];
```
-

To change an array element, use bracket notation.

```javascript
myFavoriteThings[2] = 'donuts';

// myFavoriteThings now contains [42, true, 'donuts'];
```
-

When using the const keyword, it prevents the entire array from being reassigned.
It does not prevent individual elements from being changed, or the array from being manipulated.

```javascript
const myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

// All legal
myFavoriteThings.push('coffee');
myFavoriteThings.pop();
myFavoriteThings.shift();
myFavoriteThings[1] = 36;

// Not legal, creates an error

myFavoriteThings = ['nightmares', 'thumbtacks'];
```

-
-

## Loops

-

## The For Loop

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

```javascript
function printToN(n) {
    // define iterator; define condition; define increment
    // runs until i > n;
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

-

We can change the iterator, the condition, and the increment to suit our needs.

```javascript
function printFromN(n) {
    // define iterator; define condition; define increment
    // runs until i < n;
    for(let i = n; i >= n; i--) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

``i++`` is shorthand for ``i = i + 1``;

``i--`` is shorthand for ``i = i - 1``;

-

We can increment by more than 1. 

```javascript
function printEvenNumbers(n) {
    for(let i = 0; i <= n; i+=2) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

-

## The while loop

The ``while`` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

```javascript
var n = 0;
var x = 0;

while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
```

* After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
* After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
* After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6


-
-

## Objects

Objects help us represent real-world objects in JavaScript. Using ``key: value`` pairs (sometimes also referred to as properties) we can mock out an object's
``identity``, ``state``, and ``behavior``.


-


JavaScript objects are containers that can store data and functions. The data we store in an object is not ordered — we can only access it by calling its associated key.

```javascript
let object = {
    key: value,
    property: propertyValue,
}
```

* We create the object between curly braces: {}.
* We separate each key from its corresponding value by a colon ``:``, with the key first and the value second.
* Every key-value pair is separated by a comma ``,``.

-

```javascript
let car = {
    make: 'Ford',
    model: 'Taurus',
    totalMillage: 30000,
    drive: function() {
        // TO DO: Make car move
    }
}
```

-

## Object Review

-

## Accessing Object Properties

You can use dot notation to access object properties

```javascript
console.log(user.username) // outputs donutLover5000
```

Or you can use bracket notation and pass in a string representing the property
```javascript
console.log(user['username']) // outputs donutLover5000
```
-

## Changing Objects

You can use dot or bracket notation to change property values

```javascript
user.username = "imAHotDog";
user['username'] = "imAHotDog";
```
-

## Adding Properties to Objects

You can use dot or bracket notation to add properties and their value.

```javascript
let car = {
    make: 'Ford',
    model: 'Taurus',
    totalMillage: 30000,
}

car.color = 'red';
car['milesPerGallon'] = 30;
```

Since neither the property ``color`` or ``milesPerGallon`` exist on the car object, they are created when we try to assign them values.

-

## Bracket vs Dot Notation

Bracket notation can be helpful when you want to use a variable as a key.

```javascript
let currentDayOfWeek = 'Friday';

const dailySpecials = {
    Monday: 'Half-off Drinks',
    Wednesday: 'Half-off Burgers',
    Friday: 'Prime Rib',
}

if(dailySpecials[currentDayOfWeek]) {
    console.log(dailySepcials[currentDayOfWeek]);
}
```

-

## Creating Methods

When an object stores a function as the value of a property, we call that function a ``method``.

Objects can have ``idenity``, ``state``, and ``behavior``. Methods represent the behavior for our objects.

```javascript
let dog = {
    speak: function() {
        return 'bork';
    }  
}
```

-

```javascript
// ES6
let dog = {
    speak: () => {
        return 'bork';
    }  
}
```

```javascript
// ES6
let dog = {
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }  
}
```

-

## The This Keyword

Often, we want our methods to interact with properties that exist on the object itself.

```javascript
// ES6
let dog = {
    isSitting: false,
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    },
    sit() {
        // ReferenceError: isSitting is not defined
        if(isSitting) {
          return "already sitting";
        } else {
          // looks for the isSitting variable up the line of scope, 
          // if it doesn't find it creates a global variable on the window object
          isSitting = true;
          return "yes hooman i'll do a sit";
        }
    }
}
```
-

```javascript
// ES6
let dog = {
    isSitting: false,
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    },
    sit() {
        // ReferenceError: isSitting is not defined
        if(isSitting) {
          return "already sitting";
        } else {
          // looks for the isSitting variable up the line of scope, 
          // if it doesn't find it creates a global variable on the window object
          isSitting = true;
          return "yes hooman i'll do a sit";
        }
    }
}
```

Referencing the property name alone has unintended behavior and causes errors. The property name alone does not grab us the property value.

-

## The This Keyword

To grab the value of a property off the current object, use the ``this`` keyword. 

```javascript
let dog = {
    isSitting: false,
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    },
    sit() {
        if(this.isSitting) {
          return "already sitting";
        } else {
          this.isSitting = true;
          return "yes human i'll do a sit";
        }
    }
}
```

In Javascript, ``this`` refers to the object we call it inside.

-
-

## Iterators

-

Loops and arrays are best friends. We can use a loop to visit each element in the array

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

for(let i = 0; i < myFavoriteThings.length; i++) {
    // do something with the current element in the array
    console.log(myFavoriteThings[i]);
}
```

-

There are quite a few scenarios in which we may need to visit each element in an array.

Arrays have a few built in ``methods`` that we can use to to accomplish common array tasks.

-

## Array iterator syntax

```javascript
arr.method(callback(currentElement, index, currentArray) {
    //your iterator
})
```

* ```arr``` - The array you are operating on

* ``method`` - The method you want to execute. Examples include ``forEach``, ``filter``, ``map`` and more.

* ``callback`` - Function to execute for each element. The callback functions for iterator methods typical accepts three arguments, ``currentElement``, ``index``, and ``currentArray``.

-

```javascript
arr.method(callback(currentElement, index, currentArray) {
    //your iterator
})
```

* ``currentElement`` - Mandatory parameter. The value of the current element being processed in the array.

* ``index`` - Optional parameter. The index of the current element being processed in the array.

* ``currentArray`` - Optional parameter. The array that forEach() is being applied to. I.E. ``arr``.

-

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

Array iterators take our callback functions and use them in a meaningful way. 

-

``.forEach()`` is used to execute the same code for every element in an array.

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

myFavoriteThings.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element);
})
```

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

for(let i = 0; i < myFavoriteThings.length; i++) {
    // do something with the current element in the array
    console.log(myFavoriteThings[i]);
}
```

-

``.map()`` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided callback function on every element in old array.

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];

let copy = myFavoriteThings.map(element => {
    return element;
})
```

```javascript
let myFavoriteThings = ['Donuts', 42, true, 'Pizza'];
let copy = []

for(let i = 0; i < myFavoriteThings.length; i++) {
    copy.push(myFavoriteThings[i]);
}
```
-

``.filter()`` checks every element in an array against a conditional to see if it meets a certain criteria,
then returns a new array with each element that meet that condition.

```javascript
let users = [{name: 'Jawn', age: 26}, {name: 'Sophie', age: 13}, {name: 'Beth', age: 18}];
let adultUsers = [];

for(let i = 0; i < myFavoriteThings.length; i++) {
  if(users[i].age >= 18) {
    adultUsers.push(users[i]);
  }
}
```

```javascript
let users = [{name: 'Jawn', age: 26}, {name: 'Sophie', age: 13}, {name: 'Beth', age: 18}];

let adultUsers = users.filter(user => {
    return user.age >= 18; 
})
```
-

Iterators help us create clean, semantic code.

## Classes

## Object Review

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language we can use to model real-world items and their ``idenity``, ``state``, and ``behavior``.

We model these items using ``JavaScript objects`` that contain ``properties`` that represent an item's identity, state, and behavior.

Groups of similar, real world items share properties. The values of these properties can be consistent, or vary. 

-

## Object Review

```javascript
let corgi = {
    breed: 'corgi',
    name: 'snuffles',
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}

let corgi2 = {
    breed: 'corgi',
    name: 'cuddles',
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}

let yorki = {
    breed: 'yorki',
    name: 'gadget',
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}

let yorki2 = {
    breed: 'yorki',
    name: 'wrinkle',
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}
```
We can avoid repeated code and create similar objects using ``classes``.

-

## Classes

Classes are the **blueprints** for objects. Rather than us creating objects directly, we can use classes as blueprints for creating objects.

```javascript
class Dog {
    constructor(breed, name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}

let corgi = new Dog('corgi', 'snuffles');
let corgi2 = new Dog('corgi', 'cuddles');
let yorki = new Dog('yorki', 'gadget');
let yorki2 = new Dog('yorki', 'wrinkle');
```

-

## Declaring Classes

We use the ``class`` keyword before the class name to declare a class.

We wrap the instructions for the class within a set of curly braces ``class Dog { }``, similar to objects.

```javascript
class Dog {
    constructor(breed, name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}
```

**Naming conventions**: Classes are capitalized to distinguish them from variables.

-

## Using Classes To Create Objects

We use classes to create objects, or ``instances`` of a class.

We create these unique instances using the ``new`` keyword which generates for us a new object using that class.

```javascript
let corgi = new Dog('corgi', 'snuffles');
let corgi2 = new Dog('corgi', 'cuddles');
let yorki = new Dog('yorki', 'gadget');
let yorki2 = new Dog('yorki', 'wrinkle');
```

Notice that using classes looks a lot like calling a function. 
That's because when we invoke, or call, the class using its name and passing in parameters, it calls a special ``function`` called a ``constructor``.

-

## Constructors

Classes contain a special ``method`` called a ``constructor``.

Constructors are called every time we use the ``new`` keyword to create a new instance. 

```javascript
class Dog {
    constructor(breed, name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
}
```

-

## Constructors

Constructors declare the properties for our objects and set them with an initial value, with the exception of methods.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        this.grades = [];
    }
    
    // TO DO: Write Methods
}
```

Remember the ``this`` keyword refers to the current object. When we use dot notation with the ``this`` keyword, we declare
new properties on our objects. Each object created with the ``Student`` class will now have a name, email, and grades property.

-

## Constructors

Students share properties, but the values of those properties can be vary. We can assign initial values for our properties through
the parameters we accept in the constructor. 

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* assigns the name and email properties
        to the specific name and email we pass in*/
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        
        // default initial value for grades
        this.grades = [];
    }
    
    // TO DO: Write Methods
}
```

We can also assign values to properties that share a default value across all objects.

-

## Methods

The ``behavior`` of our objects is defined through methods.

```javascript
// Creating a dog through a class
class Dog {
    constructor(breed, name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.name = name;
        this.hasBall = false;
    }
    
    // We can list methods underneath our constructor    
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    }
    
    fetch() {
        this.hasBall = true;
    }
}

let dog = new Dog('corgi', 'snuggles');

// Creating a dog object directly
let dog2 = {
    breed: 'corgi',
    name: 'snuggles',
    speak() {
        return 'bork';
    },
    fetch() {
        this.hasBall = true;
    }
}
```

-

## Getters and Setters

A common object design pattern is to include getter and setter methods as attributes.

Getter and setter are special ``methods`` that get and set the properties inside of an object. Using getters and setters we can:

* You can check if new data is valid before setting a property.
* You can perform an action on the data while you are getting or setting a property.
* You can control which properties can be set and retrieved.
    
-

## Getters and Setters

When using getters and setters, we prepended the property names with underscores (_). 
Javascript developers *sometimes* use an underscore before a property name to indicate a property or value should not be modified directly by other code.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* these properties should only be
        accessed through getters and setters*/
        this._name = name;
        this._email = email;
        this._grades = [];
    }
    
    // TO DO: Write Getters and Setters
}
```

-

## Setters

Setters are great for validating input before mutating a value.
We create a setter by using the ``set`` keyword before the method declaration.  

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* these properties should only be
        accessed through getters and setters*/
        this._name = name;
        this._email = email;
        this._grades = [];
    }
    
    set email(newEmail) {
        if(typeof newEmail === 'string') {
            this._email = newEmail;
        }
    }
    // TO DO: Write Getter
}
```

-

## Setters

We name our setters the name of the property we are trying to mutate, minus the ``_``. Setters except **exactly one** parameter, representing the value we are trying to set the property to. 

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* these properties should only be
        accessed through getters and setters*/
        this._name = name;
        this._email = email;
        this._grades = [];
    }
    
    set email(newEmail) {
        if(typeof newEmail === 'string') {
            this._email = newEmail;
        }
    }
    // TO DO: Write Getter
}
```

-

## Setters

When we create a setter, a **property** of the same name is automatically created on the object. 
The setter method is called when we try to change the value of that property using ``=``, passing in the value on the right side of the ``=`` sign.

```javascript
let student = new Student('Jawn', 'jdoe@gmail.com');
student.email = 'jawndoe@zipcodewilmington.com';
student.email = 42;

console.log(student._email); // will read 'jawndoe@zipcodewilmington.com'
```

Because we don't yet have a ``getter``, we need to access the property we just mutated through ``_email``, which we shouldn't do. Let's fix that. 

-

## Getters

We create a getter by using the ``get`` keyword before the method declaration.  

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* these properties should only be
        accessed through getters and setters*/
        this._name = name;
        this._email = email;
        this._grades = [];
    }
    
    get email() {
        return this._email;
    }
    
    set email(newEmail) {
        if(typeof newEmail === 'string') {
            this._email = newEmail;
        }
    }
}
```

-

## Getters

Getters take 0 parameters, and simply return the value of the associated property. 
We name our getters the name of the value we're trying to return, minus the ``_``.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, email) {
        /* these properties should only be
        accessed through getters and setters*/
        this._name = name;
        this._email = email;
        this._grades = [];
    }
    
    get email() {
       return this._email;
    }
    
    set email(newEmail) {
        if(typeof newEmail === 'string') {
            this._email = newEmail;
        }
    }
}
```

-

## Getter

When we create a getter, a **property** of the same name is automatically created on the object. 
The getter method is called when we try to access that property.

```javascript
let student = new Student('Jawn', 'jdoe@gmail.com');
student.email = 'jawndoe@zipcodewilmington.com';
student.email = 42;

/* now we can use our getter, email.
Since we aren't trying to assign it a new value,
the getter method is called instead of the setter
method
*/
console.log(student.email); // will read 'jawndoe@zipcodewilmington.com'
```
-

## Inheritance

Classes can borrow and extend functionality of other classes through ``inheritance``.

When multiple classes share properties or methods, they become candidates for inheritance.

With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share. The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent class.

-

## Inheritance

Let's say we want to recreate the Doggo chart. 
Doggos share many properties, but specific doggos have different values for those properties, and sometimes even have extra properties and methods.

```javascript
class Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed, size) {
        this._name = name;
        this._breed = breed;
        this._size = size;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
}

class Pupper extends Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        this._name = name;
        this._breed = breed;
        this._size = 'smol';
    }
}
```

## Superclasses

Since ``Pupper`` extends ``Doggo``, ``Doggo`` is the super class of ``Pupper``.

``Pupper`` therefore inherits the properties and methods from ``Doggo``.

Puppers share the same properties as doggos, but their size is always smol. 
When creating a pupper, we should be able to set its name and breed, but not its size.

-

## Calling the superclass constructor

In the previous example, we set the ``_name``, ``_breed``, and ``_size`` properties of ``Pupper`` manually, even though it extends from ``Doggo``.

-

## Calling the superclass constructor

Doggo already has a constructor that sets these properties, and we can call it using the ``super`` method. The super method calls the superclass's constructor.

```javascript
class Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed, size) {
        this._name = name;
        this._breed = breed;
        this._size = size;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
}

class Pupper extends Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed) {
       super(name, breed, 'smol');
    }
}
```

-

## Calling the superclass constructor

```javascript
class Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed, size) {
        this._name = name;
        this._breed = breed;
        this._size = size;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
}

class Pupper extends Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed) {
       super(name, breed, 'smol');
    }
}

class Woofer extends Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name, breed, 'big ol');
    }
}
```
-

## Calling the superclass constructor

We can create chains of inheritance. Sub classes can also add properties or methods not available on its superclass.

```javascript
class Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed, size) {
        this._name = name;
        this._breed = breed;
        this._size = size;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
}

class Woofer extends Doggo {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name, breed, 'big ol');
    }
}

class Grizlord extends Woofer {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name, breed);
        this._eatsAHumans = true;
    }
    
    eatHuman(human) {
        human.isDead = true;
    }
}
```

## Static methods

Static methods are methods that **do not** operate on instance properties. 
Because they do not operate on instance properties, we do not need to create a new object to use these methods.
We can use these methods directly on the class.

```javascript
// Notice how we did not create a new Date object. We simply used the date class
let date = Date.now();
```

-

## Static methods

Every time you call a static method, you should expect the same output when providing the same input.

```javascript
class Calculator {
    constructor() {
        this.memory = 0;
    }
    
    static add(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    saveToMemory(x) {
        this.memory = x;
    }
}

let sum = Calculator.add(2, 2);

// in order to use memory, we need to create an instance of a calculator
let calc = new Calculator();

let sum2 = calc.add(2, 2);
calc.addToMemory(sum2);
```
